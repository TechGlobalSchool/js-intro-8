How to loop thru array elements?
-for loop 
-for...of loop

const arr = [10, 20, 30];

for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++) {
    // arr[i] 
}


for(const element of arr) {
    // element
}


NOTE: We mostly use for...of loop in case we loop thru array elements and mostly we use all the
array elements.
It might be more useful to prefer for loop in the case you need indexes of the elements for the
given task.


const arr1 = [2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = [2, 1, 2];

divide the numbers from array1 with the numbers in the array2 following the same indexes. 
[1, 3, 2]

const arr3 = [];

for(let i = 0; i <= arr1.length-1; i++) {
    arr3.push(arr[i] / arr2[i]);
}

console.log(arr3);



NESTED LOOPS 
-Any loop statement can be used in another loop.
-Executing a loop inside another loop is known as nested loops.
-The first loop is known as outer loop, and the second one which is used inside the first one is known as inner loop.
NOTE: we will cover for in loop once we learn JS Objects as it is used with objects.



for(let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


for(let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    console.log(i);

    for(let j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        console.log(j);
    }
}

Array forEach() higher order function: This is another way we can iterate through array elements 

Function expression?
higher order function?
callback function?
arrow function?


JS OBJECTS 
-It is a reference data type.
-It is consist of one or multiple key-value pairs.
-Each key-value pair is known as properties.
-We can create objects using object literals {} or the object constructor 
    const obj1 = {};
    const obj2 = new Object();


5. for...in loop  
-Used to loop Js Objects with their properties
